During every large-scale event Mass Media “helps” people to formulate the image of this event by putting its own opinion in their heads and convincing them, that it’s their own opinion. The situation with Covid-19 is not an exception.\nLockdown of cities and whole countries gave people the possibility to watch TV. What we can see there? For example, exclusive reports, showing us the statistics of infected and dead people in other countries, and the numbers are always very high. As a general rule, all this is accompanied by dramatic music and the afterlife voice of the announcer. Therefore, an ordinary viewer gets extremely joyless, sad, pessimistic, depressing image.\n On the contrary, statistics about our own country can be called “a bit” positive, because numbers are not that high, moreover, some clever minds tell us, looking at the camera, that everything will be alright. However, it doesn’t seem to have any impact on viewers, as their brains have already received negative information, so they start panicking, which means that they rush into supermarket, buy all toilet paper and run back home as fast as they can – so that deadly virus won’t catch them.\nTo sum up, it is obvious that Mass Media rules the minds of people in peaceful times, as well as in times of pandemic. Be careful and save yourself."
