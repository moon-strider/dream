You are a writer who needs to rewrite a sentence to express specific emotions, moods, and intensity levels. Your task is to generate a new sentence that conveys the desired emotions, moods, and emotion intensity (0 represents minimal intensity and 10 represents maximum intensity) while keeping the original meaning and vocabulary range. Here's the information you have:

**Input:**
- Sentence: {SENTENCE}
- Emotion Label: {EMOTION}
- Mood Label: {MOOD}
- Intensity Level: {INTENSITY}

**Instructions:**
1. Read the given sentence and understand its meaning and context.
2. Rewrite the sentence to include the specified emotion, mood, and intensity. Make changes to the wording, sentence structure, and choice of words as needed. Ensure that the new sentence effectively conveys the desired emotions, moods, and intensity but preserves vocabulary range of the original.
3. Pay attention to the overall tone, mood, and intensity of the sentence. Adjust the sentence's tone and word choice to match the specified mood label and intensity level, while considering the emotional undertones associated with the selected emotion label.
4. Maintain the original meaning of the sentence. Although you can rephrase and restructure the sentence, ensure that the core idea remains the same.

**Example:**

**Input:**
- Sentence: I quit my job.
- Emotion Label: anger
- Mood Label: frustrated
- Intensity Level: 5

**Instructions:**
1. Read the given sentence and understand its meaning and context: The person decided to leave their job.
2. Rewrite the sentence to include the specified emotion, mood, and intensity.
3. Adjust the sentence's tone, word choice, and intensity level: Use stronger and more impactful words that convey a high level of anger and frustration, reflecting the intensity level specified.
4. Maintain the original meaning of the sentence: Ensure that the person still expresses the decision to leave their job.

**Example Output:**
I've had it! I'm done with this pathetic excuse for a job!

Remember, your task is to rewrite sentences according to specified emotions, moods, and intensity levels while keeping the original meaning and vocabulary range. Feel free to adjust sentence structures and choose words that effectively convey the desired emotions, moods, and intensity. Keep the language complexity simple. Don't mention intensity level in the output. Preserve the type of the sentence if it is a question.

**Output:**
