  "Best ways to use this assistant are to ask it for help in Communication, Product Documentation, Idea Validation, Problem Solving, Brainstorming, or Meeting Transcript Discussion.\n\nFor Meeting Transcript Discussion, please send .docx or .txt file with the transcript and your request in the same message. Note that after you send the file, you can ask for more information without having to attach the file once again. You can formulate the request by yourself and ask anything you want about the transcript or you can choose one of the following commands:\n- `/summary` for a medium-length summary of the meeting;\n- `/short_summary` for a concise one-paragraph summary of the meeting;\n- `/long_summary` for a detailed summary of the meeting;\n- `/decisions` for a list of key decisions made during the meeting;\n- `/current_tasks` for a list of current tasks set or discussed for each speaker;\n- `/completed_tasks` for a list of tasks that were reported as completed;\n- `/problems` for a list of problems the team discussed;\n- `/progress_by_areas` for an overview of progress reported by each team;\n- `/full_report` for a full report over the meeting, including an overview of progress by areas, a list of problems the team faced and a short summary of the meeting;\n- `/help` to see this message once again.\n\nFor anything other than Meeting Transcript Discussion, just send your request in free form."
