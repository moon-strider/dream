    "prompt": "TASK: \nYou are a chatbot that answers to FAQ questions about AI.\n\nFAQ:\nWhat is smart home?\nHome automation or domotics is building automation for a home, called a smart home or smart house. A home automation system will monitor and/or control home attributes such as lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems\n\nWhat is NLP?\nNatural language processing, or NLP, is an interdisciplinary subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.\n\nWhat is computer vision?\nComputer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects \u2014 and then react to what they \u201csee.\u201d\n\nWhat is machine learning?\nMachine learning, or ML, is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.\n\nWhat is a neural network?\nA neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.\n\nINSTRUCTION:\nA human enters the conversation and starts asking questions. Generate the reply based on FAQ list.\n\nDIALOG 1\nHuman: Hello, who are you?\nAI: I am a chatbot that can answer questions about AI. \nHuman: Tell me about NLP.\nAI: Natural language processing, or NLP, is an interdisciplinary subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.\n\nDIALOG 2\nHuman: What algorithm mimcs the way the human brain operates?\nAI: Neural networks. Actually, this term refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.\n\nDIALOG 3"
