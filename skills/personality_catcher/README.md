# Personality Catcher Skill
## Description

This skill is created in order to be able to change the bot personality.

Note: this is a paragon of a crutch-driven development, so the solution temporal (and only for devs)


## Getting started

To change the bot persona:
1. in Telegram, when talking to your bot, send `/start` command
2. Then using a command `/new_persona` send the new persona description (use `\n` at the end of the sentences)
3.`\n` works as a separator for sentences.

## Crutches

All the dev crutches are marked as `# TODO: rm crutch of personality_catcher`
